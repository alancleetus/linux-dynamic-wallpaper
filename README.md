Python script to dynamically gets images from unsplash.com based on screen resolution and set it as your wallpaper for linux desktops.

Usage:
- change the bg_path variable to the directory where you want to save the images
- run code to change wallpaper

I run this script every hour with cron jobs using "0 * * * * python3 {path to file}"
